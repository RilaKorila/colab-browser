# Colab Library
This website is for teachers and students who would like to start programming with Python.

This website shares practice problems of Google Colabratory. Users can create a copy of a colab file, and edit it on their own Colab Account.

## How to Build
After cloning this repository, run the following command.
> npm install

> npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:3000/

## micro CMS
I have a co-creator of this website, and let him add data on database freely. Moreover, PC in school does not have so much spec, so availability to open this site even under slow network.
Therefore, I chose microCMS in order to stock data.

## Future
In the future, I would like many teachers or students to post colab files, and make this website a kind of libraries.
